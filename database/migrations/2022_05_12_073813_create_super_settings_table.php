For                            these purposes, “publicly available” means information that is lawfully made available from                            federal, state, or local government records, if any conditions associated with such information.                            “Publicly available” does not mean biometric information collected by a business about a                            consumer without the consumer’s knowledge.

This information will be kept confidential, however,                            aggregate statistics that do not personally identify an individual will be kept by us and such                            aggregate statistics may be made available to other members or third parties.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Interest-based advertising&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            Advertisements appearing on the portal may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web                            advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies or other technologies on the                            portal. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize                            your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement                            servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which                            advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted                            advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            We work with third-parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their                            own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our portal in order to provide                            you with tailored advertisements on our portal and across the Internet. These companies may                            collect information about your activity on our portal and third-party websites (such as web                            pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this                            information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver                            ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites. This information may also be used to                            evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising: For more information about interest-based advertising                            and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from                            third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada,                            please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at                            &lt;a href=\"http://youradchoices.ca/choices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;http://youradchoices.ca/choices&lt;/a&gt;                            .                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these                            tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will                            still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about                            you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s                            instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to                            the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use. Once                            you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            If we plan to use your Personal Information in future for any other purposes not identified                            above, we will only do so after informing you by updating this Privacy Policy.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Disclosures &amp;amp; transfers&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            We have put in place contractual and other organizational safeguards with our agents and service                            providers (see further below) to ensure a proper level of protection of your Personal                            Information (see further Security below). In addition to those measures, we will not disclose or                            transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your permission, except as specified                            in this Privacy Policy (see further Important Exceptions below).                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            As at the date of this Privacy Policy, we share Personal Information about you in respect of the                            portal only with service providers that provide services on our behalf. We use service providers                            to improve our portal and provide services such as hosting our portal, providing advertising                            services, email marketing services, cloud services, and analytics advertising services.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            We may also share your Personal Information with third parties with your consent such as if you                            request information about third party products or services or if you apply for products or                            services offered by third parties through Your Broker Journey.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            Our servers (and certain service providers) are also located in Canada and accordingly your                            Personal Information may be available to the Canadian government or its agencies under a lawful                            order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal                            Information.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve the portal. These third parties                            may have limited access to databases of user information solely for the purpose of helping us to                            improve the portal and they will be subject to contractual restrictions prohibiting them from                            using the information about our members for any other purpose.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Sharing of personal information&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            Generally, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent                            unless permitted or required by applicable law. There are some situations in which we may                            disclose your personal information without your consent. For example:                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;when we are required or authorized by law to do so, for example if a court issues a                                subpoena;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;where it is necessary to establish or collect fees;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if we engage a third party to provide administrative services to us (like computer back-up                                services or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by our privacy policy;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            In some cases, your consent will be implied. For example, when the services we are providing to                            you require us to provide your information to a third party (such as to a lender in a real                            estate mortgage transaction) we would rely on your implied consent to the disclosure. Lastly,                            from time to time we may transfer your personal information to Your Broker Journey’ service                            providers. Under                            PIPEDA, a transfer to a service provider is not considered to be a disclosure for which your                            consent is required; however, we will use contractual or other means to ensure that the third                            party service provider is bound by obligations regarding privacy that are consistent with this                            Policy and our obligations under PIPEDA. Examples of transfers to service providers would be                            situations in which we contract with third parties to provide us with services such as archival                            file storage or insurance. Service providers may be located in various countries, so please be                            aware that authorized officials of governments in those countries may be lawfully able to access                            your personal information without your knowledge or consent pursuant to the laws of such                            countries. To the extent that we are permitted to do so by applicable law, we will notify you if                            we are advised that this access has occurred.                            &lt;br&gt;                            &lt;br&gt;                            We might share your data with third parties for business purposes or for any of these reasons:                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=\"lead tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auditing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detecting fraud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debugging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internal research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            With your consent, we might share your personal information with third parties, including our                            affiliates, mortgage partners and service providers, for these reasons:                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=\"lead tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Business purposes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analytics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-populating your information to make your experience easier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            To opt out of sharing your data, please contact us by email at &lt;a href=\"mailto:support@uat.Your Broker Journey.com\"&gt;support@uat.Your Broker Journey.com&lt;/a&gt;.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Accuracy of your personal information&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            It is important that the personal information that we have on file be accurate, complete and                            up-to-date. If, during the course of any matter through which you are using the Your Broker                            Journey portal,                            any of your personal information changes, please inform us so that we can make any necessary                            changes. We may also ask you from time to time whether your personal information is up-to-date.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Cookies and other website technologies&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website.

You also have a right to request access to your personal                            information and receive an accounting of how that information has been used and disclosed,                            subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. For example, if the requested information would                            reveal personal information about another individual, your access may be limited or denied. If                            your request for access is denied, Your Broker Journey will notify you in writing of the reason                            for the                            denial. Your Broker Journey does not use your social insurance number as a way of identifying or                            organizing                            the information we hold upon you.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Website privacy&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            Like most other organizations, we may monitor traffic patterns, site usage and related site                            information. We may provide aggregated information to third parties, but this does not include                            any personally identifiable information.                        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 class=\"mt-4 primaryTextColor\"&gt;Changes to this privacy policy&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=\"lead  tertiaryTextColor\"&gt;                            We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
